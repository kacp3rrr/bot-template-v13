# Setup
Upon cloning the repository and opening it up in your code editor, open the terminal and run the following:

    npm install

This will install all the dependencies for the bot to function

From here, all you have to do is edit the `config.json` file and input your bot's secret token in the "token" section

 

    {
	    "prefix":"!",
	    "token":"TOKEN HERE" <-- Your token goes here
    }

# Running

To start up the bot, type `node index.js` in your terminal

Your bot should be online so long as you don't close your terminal
